## Project Todo List

Here you will see what is left to complete before this engine is ready for sharing/production.

### Scene/State Items

Each scene/game area can be considered as a _scene_. The stack can have scenes pushed on to it and in doing so the top most scene is the one executed during the game loop with all else effectively "paused."

* [x] State Base
* [x] Working Example of State system

### Scene Rendering / User Input

Development of a Rendering Interface; the idea behind this is that the developer can choose the render driver, or develop one of their own. We will provide one for [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) and potentially [gdamore/tcell](https://github.com/gdamore/tcell).

* [x] Render Base Interface
  * [x] Default Raylib Driver Implementation
* [x] Working Example of Raylib render driver

With the Raylib driver comes the concept of Spritesheets and Tilesets. This is because Raylib will be a "Virtual console":

* [x] Raylib Tileset
* [x] Raylib Spritesheet

### Maps & Map Generation

* [ ] Map Base
* [ ] Map Camera
* [ ] Map FOV
 * [ ] Default FOV implementation (and interface)
* [ ] Map Generation Interface
  * [ ] Roguelike Room Generator (example)
* [ ] Map Camera

### Entities

* [ ] Entities Base

### GUI Todo Items

The GUI system will be based upon that available in [afolmert/libtcod-go](https://github.com/afolmert/libtcod-go/blob/master/tcod/gui.go) but modified to work with our render engine implementation.

* [x] GUI Base
* [x] GUI Widget Base
  * [x] Button Widget
  * [x] Radio Button Widget
  * [x] Toggle Button Widget
  * [ ] Status Bar Widget
  * [x] Container Widget
    * [x] Vertical Container Widget
    * [x] Horizontal Container Widget
  * [ ] Toolbar Widget
    * [ ] Toolbar Separator Widget
  * [ ] Label Widget
  * [ ] TextBox Widget
  * [ ] Slider Widget
* [ ] Input Handling
  * [ ] Keyboard Events
  * [ ] Mouse Events
* [ ] Colour Themes
* [ ] Working Examples for all above

### Developers

### Special Thanks
A huge thank-you to Jice, Mingos and others for the [libtcod](https://github.com/libtcod/libtcod) library, Adam Folmert and others for [libtcod-go](https://github.com/afolmert/libtcod-go); without either project this one would not exist. Another huge thank-you to /r/roguelikes and their discord community for both inspiration and help. #roguelikedev
